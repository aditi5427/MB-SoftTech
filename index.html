            <h1>PayPal enables transfer of digital currencies to external wallets</h1>
            <div>
                The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy and sell crypto on its platform.
            </div>
            <img id="image" src="download.jpeg" alt="">
            <div>After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October 2020, PayPal is finally
                allowing users the ability to natively transfer, send and receive digital assets between PayPal and
                other
                wallets and exchanges. As of Tuesday, the feature is available to select U.S. users, with the feature
                expanding to all eligible U.S. users in the coming weeks. The first batch of supported coins consists of
                Bitcoin </div>
            <div><strong>BTC</strong> <span>>$16,704</span>
                , Ether<strong> ETH</strong> <span> $1,217</span>, Bitcoin Cash<strong> BCH</strong> <span>$100</span>,
                and
                Litecoin <strong> LTC</strong> <span>$74.58</span>
            </div>

            <div>Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and enter the crypto section of the application to
                start transferring coins. Users are generally required to complete a one-time ID verification before the
                procedure.
            </div>
            <div>Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based on their respective
                blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not incur such fees. To protect users' privacy, the
                firm generates a new recipient address for each transaction into one's PayPal account. PayPal will also
                not
                charge fees for incoming transfers,
            </div>
            <div>The company is also working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services, such as central bank
                digital currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also exploring the possibility of launching
                its
                own stablecoin, dubbed "PayPal Coin." The discovery came after a developer found evidence of such a
                stablecoin within the source code of the company's iPhone app.

            <h1>Italian Parliament Approves 26% Crypto-Gains Tax in 2023 Budget</h1>
            <div>Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's new bill also includes an incentive for those declaring crypto for tax
                purposes.
            </div>
            <img id="image" src="download.jpeg" alt="">
            <div>Crypto traders in Italy will be subject to a 26% capital-gains tax starting in 2023, according to a new
                budget that won parliamentary approval on Thursday.
                Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's 2023 expansionary budget – which was completed in a rush before
                the
                end of the year – features 21 billion euros ($22.3 billion) in tax breaks to assist businesses and
                households facing the energy crisis, Reuters <span>reported</span>.
            </div>
            <div>In Italy, where crypto <span>remains largely unregulated,</span> the 387-page budget legitimizes crypto
                assets by
                defining them as "a digital representation of value or rights, which can be transferred and stored
                electronically, using the technology of distributed ledger or similar technology."
            </div>
            <div>Italy's (and most recently Portugal's) move to introduce a capital-gains tax on crypto comes ahead of
                the
                implementation of the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation that promises a
                licensing
                frameworks and stringent operating requirements for crypto-service providers in the 27-member bloc.
            </div>
            <div>The 26% rate applies to gains from crypto trading if they exceed 2,000 euros per tax period. As an
                incentive for declaring crypto profits, the new bill also sets a "substitute income tax" for investors
                at
                14% of the value of the assets held as of Jan. 1, 2023, instead of the cost at the time of purchase.
            </div>
            <div>According to the new rules, losses from crypto investments can be deducted from profits and be carried
                forward.
            </div>
            <div>Investors, however, may require some additional guidance on what qualifies as a taxable event as the
                document also says, "the exchange between crypto assets having same characteristics and functions,"
                doesn't
                constitute a "fiscal case."

            <h1> Microstrategy Buys More Bitcoin — Company's Crypto Holdings Grow to 132,500 BTC
            </h1>
            <img id="image" src="download.jpeg" alt="">
            <div>Microstrategy is now holding approximately 132,500 bitcoin following its most recent purchases. This
                year,
                the world’s largest cryptocurrency has emerged as “the institutional-grade digital asset,” said
                Microstrategy founder Michael Saylor.
            </div>
            <h2>Microstrategy Acquires More Bitcoin</h2>
            <div>
                Nasdaq-listed Microstrategy Inc. announced Wednesday that it has purchased more bitcoin for its
                corporate
                treasury. Michael Saylor, the company’s founder and executive chairman, tweeted Wednesday:
            </div>
            <div>Microstrategy has increased its bitcoin holdings by ~2,500 <span>BTC</span>. As of 12/27/22
                Microstrategy
                holds ~132,500
                bitcoin acquired for ~$4.03 billion at an average price of ~$30,397 per bitcoin.
            </div>
            <div>In its <span>filing</span> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microstrategy
                clarified
                that the
                2,500 coins were acquired between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 by its wholly owned subsidiary Macrostrategy.
            </div>
            <div>The subsidiary bought approximately 2,395 <span>BTC</span> at an average price of $17,871 per coin
                between
                Nov. 1 and
                Dec. 21. It then sold about 704 <span>BTC</span> at $16,776 per coin on Dec. 22. Macrostrategy then
                bought
                about 810 more
                <span>BTC</span> at $16,845 per coin on Dec. 24. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at
                $16,656.80.
            </div>
            <div>The bitcoin sale in December marked the first time Microstrategy sold its bitcoin since it began
                <span>accumulating</span> the crypto for its corporate treasury in 2020. The company cited tax reasons
                for
                selling <span>BTC</span>.
                “Microstrategy plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous
                capital gains, to the extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently
                in
                effect, which may generate a tax benefit,” the SEC filing describes.
            </div>
            <div>Saylor said in an <span>interview</span> last week:</div>
            <div>The most positive thing of the year is the emergence of bitcoin as the institutional grade digital
                asset
                and the clarity that … there is one crypto asset that’s a digital commodity … Bitcoin is that commodity.
            </div>
            <div>The executive noted that both the <span>chairman of the SEC</span> and the chair of the Commodity
                Futures
                Trading
                Commission (CFTC) have confirmed that <span>bitcoin is a commodity.
                </span>
            </div>
            <div>Saylor previously <span>explained</span> that Microstrategy is investing in <span>BTC</span> “for the
                long
                term.” He
                added: “Our
                strategy is to buy bitcoin and hold the bitcoin, so there’s no price target … I expect bitcoin is going
                to
                go into the millions. So, we’re very patient. We think it’s the future of money.”

            <h1>Bitcoin Miners’ Revenue Hits $9.55 Billion in 2022</h1>
            <div>2022 has been a rough and tough year for investors, traders, cryptocurrency businesses, and miners in
                general. The prolonged bear market, exacerbated by a series of catastrophic events, posed a threat to
                miners.
            </div>
            <div>Miners were dealing with a variety of issues, including defaulted loans, quarterly losses, and soaring
                bitcoin <span>hashrates</span> that reached all-time highs. All these factors were affecting the
                profitability of the
                miners and were causing sell pressure.
            </div>
            <div>The situation was aggravated when cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin’s, plummeted. Bitcoin, which
                was
                hovering around $48,000 last year, hit a low of $15,590 by the end of 2022. According to the data
                collected
                from The Block, bitcoin miners’ revenue hit $9.55 billion in 2022.
            </div>
            <h2>Bitcoin miners’ revenue dropped in 2022</h2>
            <div>Bitcoin, which is trading at $16,721 at press time, has been on a downward spiral alongside other
                cryptocurrencies. The falling cryptocurrency prices had a major effect on the income and profits of
                miners.
                Even though the $9.55 billion in revenue in 2022 seems like a large number, it is comparatively lower
                than
                that of 2021.
            </div>
            <div>Over the course of 2021, bitcoin miners made more than $15 billion in revenue, according to the data
                from
                the block. This was actually considered to be a 206% year-over-year increase.

                said.
            </div>
            <div>The self-described game theorist admitted his role in draining Mango Markets’ treasury shortly after
                the
                incident in mid-October, and may now be the first U.S. resident to face charges for his role in

                a <span>decentralized-finance </span>trading platform.
            </div>
            <div>Eisenberg faces charges of commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, according to a <span>filing
                    unsealed
                    Tuesday.</span> The charges could see punishments ranging from fines to prison time.

            <div>A deposition signed by FBI Special Agent Brandon Racz alleges Eisenberg “willfully and knowingly”
                manipulated the sale of a commodity – namely futures contracts on Mango Markets.

            <div>“Eisenberg engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation of the price of
                perpetual futures contracts on a cryptocurrency exchange called Mango Markets, and other manipulative
